react-slidedown
============================
React component which uses CSS to animate a child from its current height to ```height: auto``` when mounting/updating/unmounting.

## Overview ##

CSS does not currently support animating element height to ```height: auto``` and so *normally* javascript is used to achieve this effect.

This component uses CSS to perform the animation, following an algorithm ([first described here](http://n12v.com/css-transition-to-from-auto)). The desired height of the element is calculated, and then css is used to transition that height. After the transition has completed the height is set to ```height: auto```.

react-slidedown is perfect for dropdown lists, popup menus, accordions and closeable panels which have varying sized content.

I am not aware of any cross-browser issues from IE10 and onwards.

## Installation ##

```sh
npm install react-slidedown --save
```

## Usage ##

Simply wrap the component you want to slide with the ```SlideDown``` component:

```js
import React from 'react'

import {SlideDown} from 'react-slidedown'
import 'react-slidedown/lib/slidedown.css'

export function MyDropdown(props) {
  return (
    <SlideDown className={'my-dropdown-slidedown'}>
      {props.open ? props.children : null}
    </SlideDown>
  )
}
```

In the example above the css file needed by react-slidedown is included via JavaScript which is the normal way of doing things when using [webpack css-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader), it is also populated in the ```style``` property of package.json so if you are using [parcelify](https://github.com/rotundasoftware/parcelify) it should get included automatically. Otherwise it is also possibe to import it from css:

```
@import "node_modules/react-slidedown/lib/slidedown.css";
```

## Example ##

To quickly see a live demonstration of react-slidedown go [here](https://ykxm1vz5vv.codesandbox.io/).

To build and run this example project:
```
git clone https://github.com/frankwallis/react-slidedown.git
cd react-slidedown
npm install
npm start
```

## Customisation ##

You can customise the transition used for the animation by overriding styles on the ```SlideDown``` component:

```cs
.react-slidedown.my-dropdown-slidedown {
    transition-duration: 1.2s;
    transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.1, 0.7, 1.0, 0.1);
}
```

The default values used are:

```cs
.react-slidedown {
    transition-duration: .5s;
    transition-timing-function: ease-in-out;
}
```
